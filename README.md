# PyLeanCanvas
## Lean Canvas
The Business Model Generation is a good decision to illustrate the planing and marketing strategies for business success.

The purpose of Ash Maurya was to develop an itinerary that would help entrepreneurs, from the birth of the idea to the creation of the startup or company. His intention was to be able to express what was more uncertain (more than one probability) or more risky (high uncertainty)

Ash made some change to the Alexander Osterwalder's canvas for help to startup company. He add more elements (This data was extract from [here](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas)):

* **Problem**: a problem box was included because several businesses do fail applying a lot of effort, financial resources and time to build the wrong product. It is therefore vital to understand the problem first.

* **Solution**: once a problem has been recognized the next thing is to find an amicable solution to it. As such, a solution box with the Minimum Viable Product “MVP” concept was included.

* **Key Metrics**: a startup business can better focus on one metric and build on it.  The metrics include the range of products or services you want to provide. It is therefore crucial that the right metric is identified because the wrong one could be catastrophic to the startup.

* **Unfair Advantage**: this is basically the competitive advantage. A startup should recognize whether or not it has an unfair advantage over others.

## This project
This project have two target.

1. Make an interactive Lean Canvas that help to startupers work collaboratively. For that purpose, first we have to make a real time system that the people can see the changes on RT.

2. The second target is and experiment that try to use the Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) and SysML to try to work in this project. The idea is that exist a group of "System Engineer" that design the system and then the developers make implements.

## Models
In PyLeanCanvasModel folder is the model of the system. We work with Papyrus and SysML. For more information  you can read: https://eclipse.org/papyrus/ and  http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.4/
